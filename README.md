## Test plan

### 1. Authentication: Login / Registration
- Test Setup

    Mock Database: Use a library like pytest-mock, unittest.mock, or factory_boy to create a mock database or mock ORM models (e.g., SQLAlchemy models).
    Preconditions:
        Create a mock database with user data for login tests.
        Ensure the registration process interacts with the mock database.

- Test Cases

    Login: Test a Pre-registered User
        Precondition: Mock a user with a known email and password in the database.
        Steps:
            Send a POST request to the login endpoint with valid credentials.
            Send a POST request to the login endpoint with invalid credentials.
        Expected Results:
            Valid credentials return a success response (e.g., 200 or 302 status).
            Invalid credentials return an error response (e.g., 401 Unauthorized or 400 Bad Request).

    Register: Test by Registering a New User
        Precondition: Mock the database to accept new user data.
        Steps:
            Send a POST request to the registration endpoint with new user details.
            Check if the mock database now contains the new user.
            Attempt to register the same user again.
        Expected Results:
            The first registration should return a success response (e.g., 201 Created).
            Duplicate registration attempts return an error (e.g., 400 Bad Request).

### 2. Chat Functionality
- Test Setup

    Mock Database:
        Mock chat messages between doctors and patients using a table or data structure.
        Use mock objects to simulate real-time message storage and retrieval.
- Test Cases

    Doctor Can Send a Message
        Precondition: A logged-in doctor.
        Steps:
            Simulate sending a message to the patient.
            Save the message in the mock database.
        Expected Results:
            The message is saved in the mock database under the correct patient-doctor session.
            The response confirms success (e.g., 200 OK).

    Patient Can Send a Message
        Precondition: A logged-in patient.
        Steps:
            Simulate sending a message to the doctor.
            Save the message in the mock database.
        Expected Results:
            The message is saved in the mock database under the correct patient-doctor session.
            The response confirms success (e.g., 200 OK).

    Doctor Can See Patientâ€™s Message
        Precondition: A patient has sent a message to the doctor (saved in the mock database).
        Steps:
            Simulate the doctor retrieving messages from the chat endpoint.
            Verify the retrieved messages.
        Expected Results:
            The doctor receives the patient message in the correct order.
